               Network Overlay Impacts to Streaming Video
             draft-deen-mops-network-overlay-impacts-latest

Abstract

   This document examines the operational impacts to streaming video
   applications caused by changes to network policies by network
   overlays.  The network policy changes incluide a wide range including
   changes to address assignment, transport protocols, routing, DNS
   resolver which in turn affect a variety of important content delivery
   aspects such as latency, CDN cache selection, delivery path choices,
   traffic classification and content access controls.

1.  Introduction

   Internet streaming has greatly matured and diversified from its early
   days of viewers watching pre-recorded 320x240, 640x480 standard
   definiton 480p movies to wired PCs connected to the Internet via
   high-latency, low-bandwidth DSL as early DOCSIS modems.

   Streaming has grown be a daily go-to video source world wide for
   billions of viewers and has expanded from pre-recorded movies to
   encompass every type of video content imaginable.  This growth to
   billions of viewers and the addition of low latency sensistive
   content and new connectivity options like WiFi, Cellular and
   Satellite in addition to high-speed DOCSIS and fibre is the world
   streaming platforms now operate in.

   Streaming platform have now have significant technical challenges to
   meet viewer expectations:

   *  (1) Delivery scales that commonly range from hundreds of thousand
      to millions of viewers simultaneously, with billions of views
      world wide daily;

   *  (2) Low latency demands from live sports, live events and live
      streamed content;

   *  (3) content resolutions and corresponding formats which have
      jumped from the days of SD-480p to 4K (3840x2160) and 8K
      (7680x4320) along with bit rates which can had data needs of
      10-24+ Mbps for 4K with 8K demanding 40 Mbps under extreme
      compression and 150-300 Mbps for high quality such as cinema;

   *  (4) devices with very divese capabilities low-cost streaming
      sticks, to Smart TVs, tablets, phones, and game consoles

   *  (5) broad range of connectivity choices including WiFi, gig speed-
      low latency DOCSIS, satellite, and 5G cellular networks;

   *  (6) application transport protocols including DASH, HLS, http2/
      tcp, http3/QUIC, WebRTC, Media over QUIC (MoQ) and

   *  speciality application transports such as SRT, HESP etc.

   To meet these techincal challenges streaming platforms have
   significantly invested in developing delivery architectures that are
   built with detailed understandings of each element in the content
   delivery pathway from the content capture all the way through to the
   screen of the viewer.

   Having an understanding and a predicatablity of the delivery path is
   essential for streaming operators and the introduction of network
   overlays based on technologies such as MASQUE especially when they
   are designed to not be easily detected, even by applications using
   them has created a new set of technical problems for streaming
   operators and network operators and for the viewers that subscribe to
   them.

   The core problem occurs when changes to network policies are made,
   often without notification or visibiltiy to applications and without
   clear methods of probing to determine and test changed behaviors that
   affect the streaming application's content delivery path resulting in
   increased latency, changes of IP address for the application as seen
   by either the application or the streaming service connection,
   changes to DNS resolvers being queried and the results returned by
   DNS, and changes to application transports such as adding or removing
   outter layer encryption are all problems that have been observed in
   production streaming platforms.

   This document dicusses the various operational impacts and attempts
   to provide a few preliminary approachs that could help mitigate the
   impacts.

2.  Network Overlay Functionality

   The Network Overlays being discussed in this document is a generic
   term to describe technology that change an applications network
   behaviors such as the routing path taken by application traffic,
   which network services such as DNS resolvers are used by the
   application and can include changes to IP address for the device or
   the IP address of the application appears from the perspective of
   connection end-points.

   The overall effect is to create a tunnel, that often applies to only
   particular protocol transports such as HTTP but not varients such as
   HTTPS or HTTP and HTTPS but not other network protocol traffic from
   the device.  The traffic affected by these overlays typically takes
   an alternate routing from the device to an ingest point, followed by
   one or more hops ac

     NS = Network Segment A-NS = Alternate (Overlay) Network Segement R
   = router   device ------ R -------- R ------------------------------
   R ---------------- R ---- R ---- dest-node    \ /    \ /    \ /    R
   ---- R ----- ingest-node ----- egrees-node ----- R --+

2.1.  Network Overlays are different than VPNs

   While conceptually similar in many ways to VPN (Virtual Private
   Network) technology, the various network overlay technologies
   currently being deployed as well as new ones currently being designed
   by the IETF differ quite siginificanlty from the older VPN approach
   they are replacing in a number of ways.

2.1.1.  VPNs typically:

   *  (1) VPNs typically are detectable by both the video application
      and often by the streaming platform.

   *  (2) VPNs typically work at the network layer of a device,
      resulting in a wide-range (if not all) transports

   *  and protocols from the devive flowing through the VPN

   *  (3) VPNs typically provide exception options allowing for
      exclusion from traversing via the VPN based on

   *  various criteria such as application, destination IP address,
      application protocol etc.

2.1.2.  Network Overlay which impact streaming applications typically:

   *  (1) Network Overlays are often undetectable by video applications
      or by the streaming plaform, when in use

   *  (2) Network Overlays often only apply to specific application
      transports such as HTTP2/TCP or HTTP3/QUIC while not

   *  applying to HTTP2/TCP+TLS on the same device.

   *  (3) Network Overlays often only apply to HTTP connections and do
      not support ICMP, non-http versions of DNS,

   *  NTP etc, and various tools used for network measurement, problem
      determination, and network manangement that are

   *  not http based.

   *  (4) Network Overlays do not expose to applications any means for
      the application to discover the policy changes

   *  the overlay will apply to the applications network connections.

   *  (5) Network Overlays do not expose mechanisms or APIs for
      applications to interact with them such as getting

   *  or setting options.
