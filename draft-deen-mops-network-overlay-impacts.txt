               Network Overlay Impacts to Streaming Video
             draft-deen-mops-network-overlay-impacts-latest

Abstract

   This document examines the operational impacts that network overlays
   which introduce new alternative policies such as addressing, routing,
   DNS resolver changes to network connections have on streaming video
   delivery.

1.  Introduction

   This work is connected to work at the SVTA.ORG - Streaming Video
   Technology Alliance and is submitted to the IETF based on an impacts
   of network overlays to streaminv video study done in the SVTA.

   Streaming video services are the fastest growing application running
   on the Internet.  The streaming of pre-recorded content such as
   movies, TV shows and video series since its commercially viable
   emergence in the late 2000s has become both a global way of accessing
   content and has become the leading source of Internet traffic.  With
   acceptance of streaming as a video delivery channel, live events such
   as news , concerts and sporting events have begun appearing on
   streaming services.  Internet Streaming of recorded and live content
   has come of age globably viewers globally over the may different
   paths - broadband, mobile-wireless and satellite.

   Streaming's subscriber growth, resolution and quality jumps from SD
   to HD to 4K and even 8K, and ever smaller latency goals have created
   a number of scaling, operational economics, and techinical challenges
   that have required innovation in both video technology - formats,
   encoding, players - and in network technology - transports, caching,
   routing, DNS - to keep up with viewer demands.

   At the same time the streaming industry has been busy developing and
   deploying technologies like SVTA OpenCaching, the Internet's own
   architecture has been undergoing fundamental changes.  While VPNs
   have long been a security tool to protect corporate connections from
   users connecting to their work networks, newer protocols like MASQUE
   and commercial services built upon them have began being widely used
   by individuals for general Internet access.

   Historically VPN users rarely accessed streaming services over VPNs,
   largely for performance reasons since in the past many VPNs did not
   have the bandwidth to support high quality video, and more recently
   becuase many streaming services have chosen to block use from VPNs
   due to their extensive use to bypass regional content distribution
   restrictions.  The result has been that VPNs have largely not had an
   operational impact to streaming platforms.

   More recently, new privacy focused transports such as MASQUE based
   http2/http3 protocol specific network overlay technologies have
   become available to consumers who and these network overlays in turn
   have become part of the delivery pipeline between their adopters
   devices and the video streaming platform service infrastructures such
   as CDN caches, authentication and UI servers and platform security
   and protection services.
